## Project Description
I have always been fascinated with the creation of Sudoku boards.
So I wanted to see if I could make an algorithm able to make solvable Sudoku Boards.
<br>
<br>
The algorithm makes a Sudoku Board by inputting random numbers (based on the Sudoku rules) until it makes a board that that fit together. This board gets stored to a file. It also stores the board into several other files, where it remove numbers, making different difficulties of the board.
