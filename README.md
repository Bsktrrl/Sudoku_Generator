## Project Description
I have always been fascinated with the creation of Sudoku boards.
So I wanted to see if I could make an algorithm able to make solvable Sudoku Boards.
<br>
<br>
This simple program is runned in the "Terminal" from "Visual Studio". The algorithm makes a Sudoku Board by inputing random numbers (based on the Sudoku rules) until it makes a board that that fit together. This baord gets stored to a file. It also stores the board into several other files, where it remove numbers, making different difficulties of the board.
